# secure-hash[crypto]

```
We advise you to replace uses of unordered_hash with our new SecureHashtable class, since we added advanced crypto to make it 14.3 times more secure.

Update: the binary was compiled with g++ and libstdc++, 64bit

We're running a demo version, try it now:

nc secure-hash.ctf.hackover.de 1337
```
