# Just Keyp Trying [forensics]
```
Here's an interesting capture of some data. But what exactly is this data? Take a look: data.pcap

 HINTS
Find out what kind of packets these are. What does the info column say in Wireshark/Cloudshark?
What changes between packets? What does that data look like?
Maybe take a look at http://www.usb.org/developers/hidpage/Hut1_12v2.pdf?
```

# do
- Wiresharkで見るとUSBのなにからしい
- 色々考えたけどこれは無理でしょ、解説見た
- どうやらLeftover Capture Dataを見るらしい(調べたら他のCTFでも使われていて典型っぽい)
- p53の対応表を見る
