I tried to login... was able to get a shell, but as a restricted user.
It seems horrendously badly configured. Which is what I would've expected.
Fortunately, I found a source code from an old unencrypted backup drive...
this one's particularly interesting...

    class AESHash(object):

        def __init__(self, key):
            self.bs = 16
            self.key = hashlib.sha256(key.encode()).digest()

        def _pkcs7pad(self, s, blksize=16):
            missing = abs(len(s) - (len(s) / blksize + 1) * blksize)
            return s + (chr(missing) * missing)

        def digest(self, user, password):
            cipher = AES.new(self.key, AES.MODE_ECB)
            q = 0
            data = self._pkcs7pad(user + password)
            for i in xrange(0, len(data), self.bs):
                block = data[i:i + self.bs]
                q ^= int(cipher.encrypt(block).encode("hex"), 0x10)
            return q

Their authentication mechanism uses some weird keyed AES-based MAC -- I've
never seen anything like it before. I'd say it's insecure, but I don't know
how to exploit it. Also, it's written in Python. Really?

Since the HMAC combines credentials in the following way... it's kind of
moot to give it a try. I've learnt from one-oh-one that h(message | key) is
secure... I think.  Motherf... I'll give up; it's late and I need to go to
sleep... over and out. For now.
