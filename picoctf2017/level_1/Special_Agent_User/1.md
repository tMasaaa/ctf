# Special Agent User [Forensics]
```
We can get into the Administrator's computer with a browser exploit. But first, we need to figure out what browser they're using. Perhaps this information is located in a network packet capture we took: data.pcap. Enter the browser and version as "BrowserName BrowserVersion". NOTE: We're just looking for up to 3 levels of subversions for the browser version (ie. Version 1.2.3 for Version 1.2.3.4) and ignore any 0th subversions (ie. 1.2 for 1.2.0)

 HINTS
Where can we find information on the browser in networking data? Maybe try reading up on user-agent strings.
```

# do
- "BrowserName BrowserVersion" がflagだとわかる
- 3level, 末尾0は無視
- HTTPを見るGET飛ばしていたのでここだろう→`Wget 1.16`→WA
- http.user_agent でfilterかけた
`User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/40.0.2214.93 Safari/537.36\r\n`
- ん？？複数あるので試しに`Chrome 40.0.2214` -> AC
- Mozillaとかはダメなので、3subversion以上のものを選べということだったっぽい
