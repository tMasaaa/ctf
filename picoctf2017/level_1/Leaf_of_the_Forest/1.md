# Leaf of the Forest
```
We found an even bigger directory tree hiding a flag starting at /problems/db39b5c002d8445dc6d2bbf49a8ccc37. It would be impossible to find the file named flag manually...


 HINTS
Is there a search function in Linux? Like if I wanted to 'find' something...
```

# do
- directoryへ移動
- find -type f | grep 'flag' -> cat
- `c99501b0fe95402ed1c9191102fe1b68` -> AC
