# What is Web [Web]
```
Someone told me that some guy came up with the "World Wide Web", using "HTML" and "stuff". Can you help me figure out what that is? Website.

 HINTS
How can you figure out how the webpage is actually built?
```

# do
- source見る
- `<!-- The first part of the flag (there are 3 parts) is 9daca0510ff -->` html
- ` * The final part of the flag is f1ef52d049f` js
- `The second part of the flag is eb6c5680635 ` css
- `9daca0510ffeb6c5680635f1ef52d049f` -> AC
