I was told there was something at IP shell2017.picoctf.com with port 58626. How do I get there? Do I need a ship for the port?

 HINTS
Look at using the netcat (nc) command!
To figure out how to use it, you can run "man nc" or "nc -h" on the shell, or search for it on the interwebz
```

# do
- `nc shell2017.picoctf.com 58626`
```
Yay! You made it!
Take a flag!
