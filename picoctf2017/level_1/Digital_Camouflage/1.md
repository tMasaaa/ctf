# Digital Camouflage [FORENSICS]
```
We need to gain access to some routers. Let's try and see if we can find the password in the captured network data: data.pcap.

 HINTS
It looks like someone logged in with their password earlier. Where would log in data be located in a network capture?
If you think you found the flag, but it doesn't work, consider that the data may be encrypted.
```

# do
- wiresharkで開いてHTTPで復元(extract)する→main.htmlにIDとPASSがある
- userid stevensj, pswrd UjZBS05oV3dvNw==
- maybe encryptedなので、これを復元することを考える。base64? `cat a.txt | base64 -d`-> `R6AKNhWwo7` -> AC
