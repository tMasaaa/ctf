Welcome to Hashes 101!

There are 4 Levels. Complete all and receive a prize!


-------- LEVEL 1: Text = just 1's and 0's --------
All text can be represented by numbers. To see how different letters translate to numbers, go to http://www.asciitable.com/

TO UNLOCK NEXT LEVEL, give me the ASCII representation of 011100000111011101101110011010010110111001100111

- 毎回暗号変わっているので、そのときのを入れる

0110100001100101011011000110110001101111

```
Correct! Completed level 1

------ LEVEL 2: Numbers can be base ANYTHING -----
Numbers can be represented many ways. A popular way to represent computer data is in base 16 or 'hex' since it lines up with bytes very well (2 hex characters = 8 binary bits). Other formats include base64, binary, and just regular base10 (decimal)! In a way, that ascii chart represents a system where all text can be seen as "base128" (not including the Extended ASCII codes)

TO UNLOCK NEXT LEVEL, give me the text you just decoded, plaid, as its hex equivalent, and then the decimal equivalent of that hex number ("foo" -> 666f6f -> 6713199)
