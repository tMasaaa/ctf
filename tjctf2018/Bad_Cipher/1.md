# Bad Cipher [Reverse Engineering]
```
My friend insisted on using his own cipher program to encrypt this flag, but I don't think it's very secure. Unfortunately, he is quite good at Code Golf, and it seems like he tried to make the program as short (and confusing!) as possible before he sent it.

I don't know the key length, but I do know that the only thing in the plaintext is a flag. Can you break his cipher for me?
