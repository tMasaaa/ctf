# Bash Loop [Binary Exploitation]

```
We found a program that is hiding a flag but requires you to guess the number it is thinking of. Chances are Linux has an easy way to try all the numbers... Go to /problems/884bb3c8fc9e0dbccc09787c1b016cd4 and try it out!


 HINTS
Either use SSH or use the Web Shell to get onto the shell server and navigate to the correct directory. Then do a quick Google search on 'bash loops'. You may need to use grep to filter out the responses as well!

c1b016cd4$ for i in `seq 1 4096` ; do ./bashloop $i | 
 'flag' ; done                                        
Yay! That's the number! Here be the flag: bcf9ac72d8721c303ae95239c2deacb3
```
- `bcf9ac72d8721c303ae95239c2deacb3` -> AC
